# Minimal-ish shake based ghc build system

This repository goes though the process of creating a custom build system
capable of compiling multi executable projects without relying on shake or cabal.

It cuts some corners and tries to reuse code from a project used in production so might be not
perfect.

Pull requests are welcome :)
